- 👋  Hi, I’m Mary Re
- 👀  I’m interested in deepening my knowledge of algorithms, js, computation and graphing libraries, UX reviews of my app projects.
- 🌱  I’m currently learning more about js methods and classes, more computation and graphing libraries, python, resource groups, what is docker, what is orchestration, what is ci/cd, becoming comfortable with more programming languages.
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on the above lists, and mostly anything else.  I 💞️ COLLABORATION.
